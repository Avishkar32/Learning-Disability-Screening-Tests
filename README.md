## üÖ∞Ô∏è ADHD Screener

**Live Demo**: https://adhd-hosted-rwmp.vercel.app/
**Code**:https://github.com/Avishkar32/ADHD_Hosted

> **About ADHD**  
> ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) affects attention span, impulse control, and focus.  
> This screener uses fast-paced, reaction-time-based games to identify inattention and impulsivity. Collected metrics are analyzed using a **Random Forest classifier**.

## üß† Dyslexia Screener

**Live Demo**: https://dsylexia-final.vercel.app/
**Code**: https://github.com/Avishkar32/Dsylexia_final

> **About Dyslexia**  
> Dyslexia impacts reading, spelling, and phonological processing.  
> This tool presents letter confusion and word manipulation challenges. Evaluation is powered by a **hybrid ML model** (SVM + Random Forest + Gradient Boosting).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Dysgraphia Screener

**Live Demo**: https://dysgraphia-screening-test-eci3.vercel.app/
**Code**: [Frontend](https://github.com/Avishkar32/Dysgraphia_Screening_Test) ‚Ä¢ [Backend](https://github.com/Avishkar32/DysgraphiaModel)

> **About Dysgraphia**  
> Dysgraphia impairs fine motor skills, handwriting, and written expression.  
> This test involves freehand drawing and tracing on canvas. User strokes are processed and classified via a **Random Forest model** trained on writing behavior patterns.

## üî¢ Dyscalculia Screener

**Live Demo**: https://dyscalculia-screening-game.vercel.app/
**Code**: https://github.com/Avishkar32/Dyscalculia-Screening-Game

> **About Dyscalculia**  
> Dyscalculia affects number sense, arithmetic processing, and spatial reasoning.  
> This screener combines interactive math puzzles with **Generative AI (LLM)** to interpret open-ended math reasoning and detect signs of numerical cognition issues.
